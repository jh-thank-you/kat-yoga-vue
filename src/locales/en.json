  "p-01a-instructor": "My name is Katarina and I was introduced to yoga first time, when I was 16 year old. My mom, who always looked for a new adventure decided to try yoga and took me with her. Our yoga instructor at that time, Mr. Eshvik, was a 70-year old ‘youngster’, who proved to us in every class that age is just a number. However, what you do with that number would depend on us.",
  "p-02a-instructor": "Alas, as it happens for most of us, my life journey took many different paths, some more difficult than others.  However, yoga stayed constant part of my life. In May 2018 I have successfully completed my 200-hours yoga teacher course in Rishikesh, India. Following year, I have also completed 500-hour yoga teacher course in Paiania, Greece. In addition,  I am certified to teach Prenatal yoga and Kids yoga. During my studies I have discovered that I enjoy helping people to find inner peace, while strengthening their bodies. And, so in October 2021 Kat Yoga had opened its doors. I offer classes to anyone,  ages 6 to over 100.",
